## Shaders

### WarpImage.shadergraph
MainTex:  
this is the image from the image component in the gameobject.  

Anim:  
Is basically warping strength. however i think this is mostly doing to be used to warp the image.

Texture2D:  
this texture is being used as a map that dictates how much warp will happen at each point of the image.  

Center:  
this is used to shift the center of the warping  

### others
there are other shaders in **Asset/Image_Warp_URP/Shaders/old/** folder, however these are betas and previous attempts.  


## Scripts

### demo.cs
this is used to change the materials, and basically make the demo work.

### CanvasSwitcher.cs
used to turn Canvases on the off.

### followCursor.cs
used to make a UI object follow a cursor.

### imageWarp.cs
this could be used along side the followCursor.cs in order to warp the image based on it's movement.
